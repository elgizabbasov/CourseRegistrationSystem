# CourseRegistrationSystem
This started as a project that I made in Java for one of my courses at the University of Calgary. It is a Course Registration System where you are able to register students into first year engineering courses offered at the University of Calgary. The program uses a database from MySQL as its data, where the students' information can be found, and is a client-server based application with a very simplistic GUI. Please reach me at elgizabbasov2001@gmail.com if you have any questions or concerns.

You can log in to students' accounts created in the MySQL database for demo purposes. 
Student information currently existing in the database: 
StudentName and StudentId respectively: 

Elgiz - 300, Farhad - 200, Tyrone - 154
