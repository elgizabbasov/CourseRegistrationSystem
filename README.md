# CourseRegistrationSystem
My name is Elgiz Abbasov and I am a third-year software engineering student. This project was a term project that I made for one of my courses
at the University of Calgary. It is a Course Registration System where you are able to register students into various courses that exist
in the database. The program uses database from mySQL as its data, where the students' information can be found and is a client-server based 
application with a very simplistic GUI. Please reach me at elgizabbasov2001@gmail.com if you have any questions or concerns.
 
You can login into students accounts created in the mySQL database. 
Student information currently existing in the database: 
StudentName and StudentId respectively: Elgiz - 300, Farhad - 200, Tyrone - 154

You can add the courses currently existing in the database, which are: 
ENGG233, ENSF409, PHYS259, MATH275, ENGG433, MATH375

The video demo run can also be found in this folder.
